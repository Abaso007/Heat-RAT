### üìãLite version difference

- It contains fewer functions
- It's less detectable than the full version

### üî®Building

In case it's the lite version, it's pointless to make a builder for it. Firstly you need to go into `main.cpp` file and insert your data in line number 38: `RemoteAccess ra = RemoteAccess("host", "username", "password");`. Then to build it manually you only need to have a Visual Studio installed with C++. I recommend you build it like release: 64/86. After the building finishes you'll find the build file in `x64\Release` or `x86\Release`.
